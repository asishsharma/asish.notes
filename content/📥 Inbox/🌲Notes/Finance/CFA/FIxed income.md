### . 
## 3. Valuation 
### Bond pricing and TVM
- Bond pricing with market discount rate
	- bond price = PV of all future CF's at market discount rate
	- premium, par, discount bonds
- YTM
	- IRR on CFs 
	- implied market discount rate
- Relationship b/w bond price and bond char
	- inverse effect : rate and price have inverse relationship
	- convexity effect
	- coupon effect: impact on interest rate of convexity is **lesser** with greater coupon rate
	- maturity effect: impact greater with greater maturity
	- Constant yied trajectory: premium bond price will come down over time to par if there is no change in yield. Same with discount bond 
- Pricing bonds with spot rates
	- spot rate: YTM on ZCB maturing at the date of each CF

### Prices and yields: Conventions for quotes and calculations
#### 1
- Flat price 
- accrued interest: $AI = \frac{t}{T}\times PMT$  
- full price: $Full = Flat + AI$

- 2 conventions: 
	- $\frac{actual}{Actual}$
	- $\frac{30}{360}$
