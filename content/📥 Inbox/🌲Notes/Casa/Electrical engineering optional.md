**8. Analog Communication:** (a) _Simon Haykin_ (b) _BP Lathi_ (c) _Singh and Sapre(TMH)_

_**Paper II**_

**1.  Control Systems:** _Nagrath & Gopal_

**2.  Microprocessors and Microcomputers:** _RS Gaonkar_

**3.  Measurement and Instrumentation:** _AK Sawhney_

**4. Power Systems:** (a) _Nagrath and Kothari_ (b) _CL Wadhwa_

**5. Power System Protection:** (a) _CL Wadhwa_(only chapters of  psp, circuit breaker)  (b) _Badriram &Vishwakarma_

**6. Digital Communication:** Same as Analog Communication. For Data Networks and 7-layered architecture I referred _Forouzan_(_TMH_).

## strategy
**_Paper – I_**

1.  **Circuit Theory**: In this topic one should be fast in solving problems. Best way to gain speed is to practice regularly from IES papers of both electrical and electronics. Do questions from single IES paper (there are 3-6 questions every year) within time limit.
2.  **Signals and systems**: Here also speed is important. It is better to make a formula sheet and revise it regularly. For DFT/FFT, refer to Oppenheim’s book on DSP.
3.  **E.M. Theory:** Read chapter 6(till 6.29), 7 and 8 from K.D. Prasad. For Smith chart and impedance matching refer Jordan & Balmain. Make the list of formulas and practice all the derivations.
4.  **Analog Electronics**: Diode, Transistors and Amplifiers can be done from any book. Topics that are to be covered from JB Gupta are: Oscillators, Op Amp, Wave shaping circuits, Multivibrators, Waveform Generators and Power supplies.
5.  **Digital Electronics**: Mano is sufficient for the part of syllabus which it covers. For topic left like Timer (look at chapter on 555 IC Timer), Comparator, S&H circuit refer to JB Gupta.
6.  **Energy Conversion**: Try to cover everything given in the syllabus from Ashfaq Hussain and make good command over all the numerical given in the book. It covers topic from IES point of view. Do all the questions asked in the IES exams thoroughly.
7.  P**ower Electronics and Electric Drives**: Topics to be covered are Chapter 2(characteristics of diode, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT), chapter 4-Thyrister(complete), chapter 5 – Thyrister commutation techniques (complete), chapter 6 –Phase controlled rectifiers(Leave dual converters), chapter 7- Choppers(Leave Thyrister Chopper circuits and multiphase choppers) , chapter 8 –Inverters(Leave force-commutated thyrister inverters, current source and series inverters) and chapter 12-electric drives(complete). Cover all the derivations (like deriving expressions for particular type of rectifier or inverter) as well as working of circuits.
8.  **Analog Communication**: Cover chapter 4(AM) and Chapter 5(on FM and PM) from BP Lathi. Random process(chapter 1) can be covered from Haykin. And Noise(chapter 4) can be covered from Singh and Sapre. Also cover AM AND FM practical modulation and demodulation circuits from Singh and Sapre.

**_Paper II_**

1.  **Control Systems**: Nagrath and Gopal is sufficient for all the topics. Practice from previous year IES and CSE papers.
2.  **Microprocessors and Microcomputers**: Cover chapters 1 to7 and 9, and parts of chapter 8 and 10(from which questions has been asked in IES exams), In peripherals cover 12, 14, 15, 16 (Focus more on whatever has been asked in IES papers).
3.  **Measurement and Instrumentation**: Cover all the instruments given in the syllabus thoroughly from the Sawhney. Here also guide will be IES questions.
4.  **Power Systems**: I did this topic from Nagrath and Kothari as I already had covered the book in graduation. Practice solved examples of both Wadhwa and this book.
5.  **Power System Protection**: Chapters of Protective relays and circuit breakers (from Wadhwa) cover large part of the syllabus in much better way. For microprocessor based relays refer to TMH book.
6.  **Digital Communication**: For PCM, DPCM, DM refer to chapter 6 of Lathi. ASK, PSK and FSK are covered much better in Haykin. Information theory and codes can be covered from either of them. Chapter 1 and 2 of Forouzan are to be covered for data networks and 7 layered architecture.
