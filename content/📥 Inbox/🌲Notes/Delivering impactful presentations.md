### Know your field
presentation is important. 
- think about your audience. what do they want? 
	- approval? binary(yes/no)? leave an impression
	- content is a Prerequisite. **know your shit**. 
	- for a yes/no meeting, know the stakeholders in advance, listen to reservations and adress them
	- for a brainstorming session- your audience needs to be heard. 
	- for people with a lot of self importance, you need to let them speak. Give them freedom.
	- Understand the purpose of the presentation.
	- be a good listener. What is being asked.  
	- confidence in answering questions
- types of audienes: 
	- fellow engineers ->
	- managers 
	- clients -> understand their job, understand how their job affects the end investor, then you can think about how you fit in.
	- Technical vs non-technical audiences: good presenters are able to synthesize big terms for all types of audiences. also good with big words. 
		- analogies also go a long way.
		- also able to adapt. 
		- for non-tech, use simple language, high level picture, 
		- 
- common topics for Financial engineers
	- research based- something you have done, or something you have read and find useful
		- result presentation
	- problem youve identified. Streamline workflow. save time, maximise productivity, minimise cost, restructuring (big picture)
	- Brainstorming session
		- latest trends, how to implement, 

- Storytelling makes the presentation
	- engaging
	- memorable. 
	- Internalising something before you say it 
	- people love passion
	- helps in describing complex idea to be understood
	- flow help people easy structure thoughts
	- makes takeaways clear
-  How to begin?
	- read the room
	- start off engagingly
	- personalized intro
- How to end? 
	- synthesize entire presentation.
	- This is what you heard
- Slide deck
	- tool to help articulate your story
	- should not be a crutch
	- very few words
	- If you look at a presentation too much, the audience is also to focus on the ppt, whereas the focus should be on you.
- Are presentations important? 
	- important FE role. Your FE models are likely to have a lot of capital behind them, so it is important for the other decision makers to have confidence in your strategy.
	- Have a story about what the data and the model says  


### Know your story
#### Storytelling
- provides narrative structure for effective communication
	- narrative makes it easier for audience to process information
- how to incorporate storytelling
	- define the problem you are solving and the main points you want to make. 
	- Also define what you want audience to feel/do after presentation
	- Story arc: 
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/LigcUij.png)
		- beginning: establish baseline(current status)(creates bond). Then explain your vision
		- Middle: bridge the gap between baseline and vision. keep contrasting between what is and what could be 
		- Ending: should be powerful, a call to action, inspiring. Elaborate on vision success. 

#### Know your story: 
- problems with presentations
	- no clear point
	- no clear benefit
	- no clear flow
	- These are caused by lack of a narrative story

- The biggest mistake: how not to start planning ppt
	- dumping ideas in slides. Slides should be the last thing you do 
	- slide deck is for communication, not planning. Slides are for your audience, not you. 
	- foundation of presentation is the story
	- What to use? one example is [[mindmap]] for a spacial thinker. outline for a linear thinker.
- foundation: what are the key points. 
	- Q. objective, cornerstones(3-5 points enuf) & related visualisation, Audience(knowledge, need, expectation)
	- agree on cornerstone points with team before working on presentation.   
- Creating a story: presentation structure
	- Story structure: some typical ex
		- Problem/solution
		- opportunity/leverage
		- case study/thesis
	- also keep in mind: Audience context, ppt starting and ending
