## Transmission and Distribution
### Introduction
* A power system is the complete system that is involved in generation, transmission, distribution of electricity
	* Generation is done by synchronous machines 
	* transmission by transmission lines 
	* distribution by distrbuters and distribution transformer 
	* utilization is done by loads connected to the system 
* grids in India
	* For India, there are 5 regional grids: Northern grid, western, eastern, northeastern, Southern grid
	* these 5 grids are interconnected. Because there are some areas like NE where there are less industries, so less utilization of power. Hence generaiton is more than demand. These areas can be called as *power surplus areas*. In the same vein, Northern and Southern grids are *power deficit areas*. 
	* For balancing this, grids being interconnected is beneficial.

	* Tie lines -> power lines are used to transfer power between different power systems. 

### Objectives of power system
1. Cost of energy(per Kwhr) minimization-2 methods
	1. economic dispatch 
	2. Economic generation
2. Consumer must be supplied with $V_{rated}$ and $f_{rated}$ 
	1. Why $f_{rated}$?   if $f_{rated}$ is not supplied, then consumer will be out of sunchronism from the rest of the system, which will cause undesirable performance, from the load perspective
	2. Why $V_{rated}$? 
		1. becasue most household appliances are rated at a particular voltage and function efficiently and properly at that particular voltage
	3. Automatic voltage and frequency control:
		1. frequency control is done by controlling speed of prime mover
		2. voltage contro can be done by either controlling excitation emf or reactive power compensation.
3. Reliable power supply
