## Electromagnetism

* Electrical machines are built upon the principle of converting energy from one form to another. 
* There are 2 types of machies: 
	* Static: eg. transformer: 
		* transformers: transferring electrical energy from one port to another port
	* rotating machines: eg. motors and generators 
		* motors: convert electrical energy into mechanical energy
		* generators: convert mechanical energy into electrical energy
* In both types, this transformation happens in the magnetic domain. And this is why it is important to understand the laws of electromagnetism. 
* what is electromagnetism? Electric fields and magnetic fields are interrelated. 
	* For example, a time varying electric field will result in **induction** of a magnetic field $\frac{dE}{dt}\rightarrow B(H)$, and a time varying magnetic field will result in induction of an electric field $\frac{dB}{dt}\rightarrow E$.
		* B is flux density, H is magnetic field. Notation. 
* such laws that relate between electric domain and magnetic domain are termed as [[laws of electromagnetism]]
*	Magnetic force: Whenever there is charge 'q' moving with a velocity 'v' in a magnetic field 'B', it experiences a force $F=q(\vec{v}\times \vec{B})$. 
	*	q is with sign, ie positive charge gets + sign, negetive charge gets - sign
* Faraday's law: Whenever there is a time varying flux $\phi$, a proportional emf is inducted in the conductor equal to $e=\frac{d\lambda}{dt}$, 
	* where $\phi$ is the flux, 
	* and $\lambda$ is the flux linkage. $\lambda=N\phi$ 
		* ![flux linkage diagram](https://i.imgur.com/7C2U5KX.png)
	* N is the number of turns to which $\phi$ is linked.
	* We need 2 things for application of faraday's law. 
		* A magnetic field, which creates a time varying flux
		* A set of conductors for emf to be induced across. 
		* relative variation between these 2 above.
			* Relative time variation: 
				* The magnetic field is varying with time. $i.e.,B=B(t)$. 
				* in this case, $\phi=[B(t)]A$, which makes $\phi(t)$ which is a function of time.
				* therefore, $e=\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}$. This 'e' is called statically induced emf
				* In this case, conductors are stationary. A good eg. is transformers.
			* Relative space variation
				* The position of conductors changes wrt magnetic field(B)
				* The emf induced is called dynamically induced emf
				* This happens in generators and motors.
