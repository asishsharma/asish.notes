# Salient points
- not the ceo. People will only listen to you if you’re influential in your actions and words
  
- Relationships imp— stakeholders and engineers. Spend time cultivating relationships

- Wrong requirements. 
	-   You rep the Cust. Cust advocacy. Wrong feature. Solve using continuous delivery and agile mindset. Vet with peers Cust req diff from prod req
	-   YOU are the source for requirements. Nobody is going to tell you you’re wrong. 
	-   Especially in enterprise(surprisingly) 

-   Data driven—insights, validation, more is better 

-   Metrics. Look up AARM

-   If you’re successful, its the team. If you fail, its the PM
	-   Inevitable

-   You the ‘what’. Not the ‘how’

-   OK to say NO
	-   Scope creep from engineers, customers, sales. 
	-   Speak up when things don’t make sense

-   Respect—liveability
