## PM 101

We kick off our 8 week cohort with an overview of the multi-faceted role of product management in technology companies. We discuss what product managers do, what they are expected to know, what they are accountable for and what factors determine a high-performance product manager and product management organization. We introduce the core building blocks for product management that will form the basis for the remainder of the course.

#### What is Product Management?

Product Managers (PMs) can have a big impact on a technology company's performance. PMs define a product’s functional requirements and then lead a team responsible for its development, launch, and ongoing improvement. Practices in Product Management aims to understand the PM role and develop skills required to perform the role by addressing the following issues:

-   What is a PM? Why are they necessary in Companies, Start-ups? Are they a mini-CEO?
-   What does a PM do and with whom do they work at different stages of the product life cycle?
-   What techniques do PMs use to understand customer needs and validate demand for a product?
-   What does a PM need to know about user experience design?
-   Why do some tech companies require PMs to write detailed product specifications?
-   How do I organize and execute my product build?
-   What does a PM need to know about technology, e.g., model-view-controller architecture?
-   How do I become the CEO of a problem and sell my product vision?

Product Managers are the ultimate advocates of the product -- and by extension, the end user -- above all else. And, like a great architect, they’ll fight tooth and nail to protect the integrity of the overall product vision.

That means that a typical Product Manager’s day might include everything from a business development meeting to a problem-solving session with engineers. The person could be looking at the birds’ eye view of the big picture one minute and conducting a microscopic examination of a single line of broken code the next.  A Product Manager jumps from design to business development, engineering to recruiting, all within a given day. That’s the beauty of being a Product Manager. You never get bored, because you’re never doing the same thing long enough to be. And, like an architect, you truly get to be involved with every step of the building process, from vision to execution.

#### Resources

One of our favorite blog posts about being a top 1% Product Manager (**from Quora):**

The top 10% of product managers excel at a few of these things. The top 1% excel at most or all of them (From Quora)

-   Think big - A 1% PM's thinking won't be constrained by the resources available to them today or today's market environment. They'll describe large disruptive opportunities, and develop concrete plans for how to take advantage of them.
-   They are problem finders and breakthrough innovators - A 1% PM observes, documents a 100 problems, and figures out how to systematically build a product that fundamentally solves all of those problems with an easy UI and a great experience
-  They paint a vision: The best product managers create a big vision-- one that is bigger than just the product itself. More importantly, they can take a complex vision, simplify it, and communicate it-- making it easy for people to get it, and be a champion for the long and short-term vision.
-   Communicate - A 1% PM can make a case that is impossible to refute or ignore. They'll use data appropriately, when available, but they'll also tap into other biases, beliefs, and triggers that can convince the powers that be to part with headcount, money, or other resources and then get out of the way.
-   Simplify - A 1% PM knows how to get 80% of the value out of any feature or project with 20% of the effort. They do so repeatedly, launching more and achieving compounding effects the product or business.
-   Prioritize - A 1% PM knows how to sequence projects. They balance quick wins vs. platform investments appropriately. They balance offense and defense projects appropriately. Offense projects are ones that grow the business. Defense projects are ones that protect and remove on the business (operations, reducing technical debt, fixing bugs, etc.).
-   Forecast and measure - A 1% PM is able to forecast the approximate benefit of a and can do so efficiently by applying past experience and leveraging comparable benchmarks. They also measure benefit once projects are launched, and factor those learnings into their future prioritization and forecasts.
-   Execute - A 1% PM grinds it out. They do whatever is necessary to ship. They recognize no specific bounds to the scope of their role. As necessary, they recruit, they produce buttons, they do , they escalate, they tussle with internal counsel, they *.
-   Understand technical trade-offs - A 1% PM does not need to have a CS degree. They do need to be able to roughly understand the technical complexity of the features they put on the backlog, without any costing input from devs. They should partner with devs to make the right technical trade-offs (i.e. compromise).
-   Understand good design - A 1% PM doesn't have to be a designer, but they should appreciate great design and be able to distinguish it from good design. They should also be able to articulate the difference to their design counterparts, or at least articulate directions to pursue to go from good to great.
-   Write effective copy - A 1% PM should be able to write concise copy that gets the job done. They should understand that each additional word they write dilutes the value of the previous ones. They should spend time and energy trying to find the perfect words for copy (button labels, nav, calls-to-action, etc.), not just words that will suffice.
-   Talks to customers - A 1% PM talks to customers all the time, obsesses about them, and doesn't buy into the bullshit that customers "don't know what they want." Customers may not know the ideal solution to their problem, but they are experts in their problem. They can always describe their pain points and they can always react to a proposed solution or prototype. Any PM that leaves the customer out of the equation will never be in the 1% category.
-   They focus: they see and communicate the bigger picture, but they focus on executing the short-term strategy like no one's business. They don't distract.
-   They are an expert at human psychology and behavior: the best product managers think about the user in every scenario-- how they would think about x feature, how they would react design. They constantly ask: what would [muse/user] do?
-   They wear many hats: they can do it all-- gracefully and seamlessly. They can guide the content direction, UI, and development-- while also wearing business development, product marketing, etc hats. They think broad AND narrow-- they understand and communicate how the product vision ties into the company (and beyond) vision. They know enough in all areas to be dangerous and have their hands in all areas to make the product and team the best it can be.
-   They show up as a leader.... everywhere and in every moment. They make everyone around them better through this leadership. They inspire people around them to think bigger, and push boundaries.
-   They are vulnerable: they admit to mistakes, they take responsibility, and they continuously work on themselves/develop through the work.
-   They make decisions quickly: they make decisions carefully, yet quickly considering multiple perspectives. They enroll and communicate these decisions effortlessly.
-   They get related: they build strong relationships with people on the team (and inside, outside, up, down, and across the company) creating space for better communication and trust.
-   They tap into intuition: the best product managers understand and seek knowledge (analytics, user behavior/research, others views) to hone their intuition. They create and make decisions listening to their gut.
-   They have a CEO's strategic mindset, a COO's cultural capacity, a Sales Officer's strive for revenue, & a Chief Science/Eng Officer's drive for elegant solutions through quantified hypothesis-based research.

	- 3 types of PM models
		- Best: **Empowered** product teams
			- to serve customers in a way that meet business needs
			- Given problems(customer/business) $\rightarrow$ discover, design and deliver solution+accountability/ownership
			- The product manager is responsible for **value and viability**
		- Bad: Delivery teams
			- having a backlog of stories to work on | Choosing a couple of them for the next `sprint` 
		- Most common: Feature teams
			- roadmap given $\rightarrow$ design and deliver
			- PM is a project manager. No decision/ownership on features.
			- Good for delivering features, not for a good product

### Assignment 1: 
Your first task is here. Almost everyone is aware that your end goal is the creation of a PRD. For those who are still skeptical about what is PRD, here is a short and crisp understanding of what is PRD?

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) describes the basic functionality of a product before it is developed. This should be the first part of your product, showing the purpose, the scope of work, who your target customers are, how they will interact with your product, and how to measure its performance.

This week's assignment is to take the first step towards the making of PRD

#### 📌 What is your idea?

(_under 100 words)_

Write a brief about the idea you have. The inspiration for this can come from anywhere but it should be expansive enough. Something grand. No holds barred. Get your Green Thinking Hat out (stands for Ideas, Possibilities & Creativity)

This assignment is divided into 3 sections:

#### 📌 Problem you're trying to solve?

_Try to answer following questions in this section:_

-   What is the problem you want to solve?
-   Why is it important to address this problem?
-   What made you think of this product?

_Hint: Scratch your brain and come up with some cool ideas that will outstand._

#### 📌  Why? What are the goals and objectives?

🌈 This section explains the problem you are solving and explains why it should be developed in the first place. It helps to set the team on the right track.

  

_Here are some questions for you to think_

-   What is the product purpose?
-   Business Objective
-   Product's features or functionalities

_Hint: Don't detail the features or functionalities, try to boil it down to MVP (Minimum Viable Product)_

#### 📌  Who is your audience?

-   Who are the target stakeholders of the solution?
-   Demographics of users
-   Pain points of users

_Hint: Try to prioritize the pain points_

🌈 To create a valuable product, you need to answer the who-what-when-how questions regarding your users. The idea of the product gets shaped when you see the product through the eyes of who will use it.

  

> Let's keep in mind that the purpose of the document is to communicate your product idea to the team.

## PPT points
- Give one example of a brilliant product innovation that failed, Spectacularly! : WHY? 
- Why does anyone use or buy anything?
	- Customers buy products and services to help themget jobs done.
	- We want to build things that people actually want to use and to invest their time, energy and money in.
	- You are not your userand the only way to understand what user’s want is discovering user’s needs correctly.
	- Whether it will bring value to your businesswould be driven by the market research and your positioning.
- Definitions used; 
	- **Job** Something that a user is trying to get done, under certain circumstances.
	- **Market** Group of people trying to get the same job done. 
	- **Competitors** A competitor is any solution being used to get the job done.Definitions
- Growth Options based on delivery scope: 
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jKh8Nkz.png)
	- Q1: Get a Job DoneBetter! :: Product innovation or Service innovation
		- If you do not want to lose market share to a more aggressive competitor, you have to continuously do this. 
		- You can do incremental improvement by focussing on one thing.
		- Or you can do breakthrough improvement by addressing multiple problems simultaneously.
		- Example: 
			- Entire cell-phone industry.
			- Movies, TV series and most of the entertainment sector
	- Q2: Get More Jobs Done!Grow your offering
		- Find ancillary or related jobs for the same users in the same circumstances and do them as well. 
		- Increase your revenue by adding more value to the offering.
		- Improve as the users / clients grow in their life. Support users at different stages of the journey
		- Examples
			- MP3 players allowed users to listen to digital music. But with iPod, users could also buy and organise music into playlists. 
			- PayTM moved from being a wallet to providing entire banking services.Q2: Get More Jobs Done!
	- Q3: Help New Customers Do a Job That Others Are Already Doing! : Expand to a lateral market
		- Targeting non-consumers.
		- In most cases product or service is similar in some form to our core offering.
		- Individuals want to get the job done but can’t because it’s either expensive or requires specialised skills
		- Examples: 
			- Zomato moved from a restaurant reviews site to food delivery platform.
			- Google moved from being just a search engine and into the email space and then entire Office suite space.
	- Q4: Help new Customers do a job that Nobody is doing yet! : *Something entirely new*
		- No formal product or service exists that solves the job adequately.
		- Home-made, piecemeal solutions are being used to service the need.
		- The job is either frequent or is similar for a large set of users
		- Examples: 
			- Uber, Swiggy, Dunzo when they all started
			- At one point of time, all tax preparation softwares
			- 
- **Personas**: 
	- Why define personas? We want to understand:
		- User’s motivations to use the product.★Frequency of job occurrence.★Expectations from the product.★Current and potential struggles with getting the job done.
		- Note: We want to go-wide try to empathise with as many target users as there are, so that we build the right solution.
	- Defining personas: (top level stuff)
		- Header
			- Fictional name — to recall this person later
			- Image — to recall the person later★Quote that summarizes what matters most to the persona as it relates to your product.
		- Demographic details
			- Relevant personal background: Age, gender, ethnicity, education level, persona groups (working moms), family status
			- Relevant professional background: Income level, job occupation and working hours, experience
			- Environments: Physical location (home, office, on the road) , Social environment (who all are around them, where are their validations coming from), Technological environment
			- Psychographics: attitudes, interests, motivations, and pain points.
		- Example: ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZfLXajG.png)
		- Define Scenario: A “day-in-the-life” narrative that describes how a persona would interact with your product in a particular context to achieve his or her end goal(s).
			- ★Define when, where, and how this scenario takes place.
			- ★Write from the perspective of the person. What are they doing before and after using your product. If possible experience their day with them, before writing this. 
			- ★If there is no product / feature yet for this persona, write about when you feel they should be motivated to use your product
		- Do remember to---Cover all relevant demographics
			- Different age groups and gender (if applicable)
			- ★Device and technologies they use
			- ★Different geographies and languages
			- ★Different job functions (B2B SaaS)
			- ★Different paying capacities.
			- ★Is the user same as the buyer? If not, cover both
		- Choosing the right Personas
			- Aiming to improve Q1 - Your set of personas should represent at least 80% of your total users.
			- ★Aiming for Q2 - Ensure that persona selection covers all your current user-base. 
			- ★Aiming for Q3 - Stretch your audience in one or more directions
			- ★Aiming for Q4 - Start with problem hypothesis and then find the personas that might benefit from a solution to the problem
	- Inputs we need
		- To get a job done, customers seek out helpful products and services. They need to succeed at getting the job done. 
		- ★Functional Jobs
		- ★Emotional Jobs
			- ○Personal Job
			- ○Social Job
	- Outcomes
		- Customers want to get the specific tasks done faster, better, or cheaper. These are the measures of the value.
		- For each job, there is: 
			- ★At least one obvious outcome that the user wants. This is the core job that the product solves. 
			- ★Multiple non-obvious outcomes that a user is expecting. These are the ones that differentiate your product from the other options
		- Outcomes have:
			- ★Unit of measure.
			- ★Direction in which the unit of measure should move.
			- ★Desired value
		- Constraints
			- Customers also need help overcoming the constraints that prevent them from getting a job done. This could be all the time or under certain circumstances.
			- Constraints are often physical, regulatory, or environmental in nature.
				- ★Working in a high-pressure environment
				- ★Safety concerns
				- ★Regulations around online payment capture
		- Keep in Mind: 
			- ★Always talk to the end users of your product even if you are making only a part of the end product.
			- ★Consider all relevant customer personas. Do not leave certain demographics out. 
			- ★Do not use someone as a proxy for the end users. 
				- ○Don’t role play the user yourself and base all your interview on that.
				- ○Don’t use sales, marketing or customer support teams as proxy. Take their input but still go and talk to users
		- How to conduct User Interviews?
			- Ask user to tell Stories★“When was the last time....”★“Tell me the last time you were very frustrated with...”★“How does a typical day start...”Why? You want them to be in a problem description mode. And not in the solutioning mode.
			- Ask them environmental questions? ★“So you were sitting at your desk in office...”★“So you were on your way back from office and... ”★“So you were just about to...“ Why? You need to know the environmental constraints
			- Ask about how they felt★“Did the time lag annoy you a lot?”★“So how did you feel when the food was spilled inside packaging.”★“So what did the friends say about the new dress?”Why? You need to know how important this job is for them. You need to know the social impact of your product.
			- Ask about what did they do next or how did they solve it finally?★“So how did you finally get the address changed? How long did it take?”★“So how did you get the lunch finally”Why? You need to know how satisfied or dissatisfied they are with the current solution? Is it really a pain that they need to solve and what all parameters, it should satisfy.
		- What NOTto do in User Interviews?
			- Do not ask direct questions★What is your evaluation criteria for this?You will receive just one or two points. You will not get the un-said criteria that is there pre, pre or during the usage of the product. ★What is a good solution for this?Again you will just receive an ideal, short-cut answer, which doesn’t cover multiple common scenario.
			- Do not let the customer generalise★How often does this happen?Instead, be specific, how many times did this situation happen in the last week / month. ★Is this a big or small problem for you?Instead, understand how does it really impact their life and what they do on a daily basis.
- Competitor Research
	- Why do competitor analysis?
		- Competitive research is the process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of companies offering products similar to yours.
		- ★Helps understand our unique value proposition. How is our product different from others in the market.★Spotting trends on when new technologies that solve similar problems are coming into market.★Updating the table-stakes with what customers are getting in the market and how we should improve with it. ★Needed to keep the pricing competent in the market.★Learning from other’s mistakes
	- Competitive Landscape
		- Market lies somewhere between these Two Poles
		- The market is young: Customers aren’t already locked into one of your competitors and you have a “green field” to harvest customers. You are fighting the status quo situation, but otherwise you’re mostly competing head-to-head with relatively few competitors. 
		- The market is saturated: Nearly every customer is already using one of your competitors to solve their problems. Now you have to “take away” each customer from someone else. It’s often not enough to just be “better” or even “cheaper”. You have to think beyond the structural conditions of the market and identify new ways to create value.
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6vj7DNR.png)
	- How to do competitive research
		- Conventional ways★Website, sales collaterals, demo videos.★What is the sales process, sales channels and partners. ★Press-releases state the direction in which company wants to move in. Any MnA activity state their strategy and vision.★Locations in which they are present, reveal the expansion strategy. Unconventional ways★Learn from their current customers. Understand what value proposition is their differentiator.★Look at their tech-stack and API documentation to understand features in great depth.★Recent hires and background of hires reveal where the company wants to position itself. ★Understand sentiment about the product in communities.
- **Opportunities: Opportunityis where a Job, Outcome or Constraint, is Under-served**
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/WrNDlrT.png)
		- Source: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/ditch-solution-first-mindset-start-defining-problem/ 
	- Selecting an Opportunity
		- Do you want to: 
			- Strengthen your Core: 
				- Pick opportunities that enhance your core business and value proposition.This opportunity with your current product should deliver much higher value than either on their own.It should enhance our competitive advantage
			- Reposition your Core
				- Reposition your offering to include non-customers and pick under-served jobs or outcomes. This opportunity doesn’t siphon revenue away from existing product lines and ultimately results in net new growth. It would require carving out resources who could focus on these innovations.
		- Criteria to filter out opportunities and pick the best
			- High level company or product goals-Do you want to increase conversions, adoptions, retentions, referrals 
			- What is your current Positioning?-What is the stage of your company and what do you want to become.
			- What are the biggest blockers to success with this opportunity-Are there any dependencies that should be addressed
			- Options that have a high likelihood of success-Depends upon the current competencies, competitive landscape and compatibility with current offerings
			- Simplest criteria: DHM framework by Gibson Biddle
				- ★Delight Customers 
				- ★in Margin enhancing 
				- ★and Hard to copy ways

## Assignment 2
Last week we finalized the idea that we want to work on. This week we will iterate on that by learning more about our market, customers and competitors

### 📌 To do

This week's assignment has two sections

#### Hypothesis

🌈 Form one or more hypotheses around your customer's problems and why your product can solve those problems.

  

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation. ie. it is what you think the answer to a question is before you know for sure.

Product teams run experiments to determine if their hypothesis is true. The process of determining if your hypothesis is true is known as **validating** your hypothesis. We will go deeper into hypothesis validation in future sessions.

Your hypothesis should have the following components summarized into one sentence.

-   Proposal
-   Impact
-   Audience
-   Data

An example hypothesis would be _Introducing a sugar free version for Pepsi will boost sales by 20% for the under 30 demographic_

A single proposal/idea/change can have multiple hypothesis statements due to varying impacts and audiences.

#### Competitor Analysis

🌈 Perform a competitor analysis on your top 3 competitors

  

One of the most important (and often overlooked) steps before we actually start building the product is to conduct market research. Market research has two main outcomes

-   Determine if there is pre-existing demand for your product
-   Identify competitors

A common benchmark across industries is that you need to be at least 10x better than existing alternatives to succeed. Identifying what potential customers are using as alternatives to your product can help you differentiate your product and provide more value.

**Indirect competitors**

A common trap that occurs during competitor analysis is not accounting for indirect competitors. Indirect competitors are unconventional, often non-technical ways that potential customers are currently solving problems similar to what your product is trying to solve. Examples of indirect competition include

-   Note-taking apps → pen and paper
-   Grocery delivery apps → calling up your neighbourhood store

🌈 We have prepared a template to help you with your competitor analysis. You can copy this into your assignment workbook and fill it up with your answers

  

[Competitor analysis template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dP6vcp3K6lriXmMJMLAFiLQYGwAUbtxa6M9pSksV6lw/edit?usp=sharing)

PS. You might not have answers to every field, but try to fill as many as you can. Also, you can write it in a different format if you want.

- Why measure anything, why analytics 
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/tnyD5OG.png)
	- Truth > Kernel of Truth
		- User interviews capture what users SAY they would do.
		- Analytics captures what users ACTUALLY do.
	- Influence without authority
		- Job of PM: Deeply understand customer pain/opportunities to propose solutions and then rally different teams to solve that problem.
		- User Interviews → why is there a problem
		- Analytics → do enough people feel the pain?
		- Why + Does it matter → Trust + Influence to make decisions
	- Recap: Why measure anything?
		- Complements user interviews
		- ★Helps teams understand what people ACTUALLY do in the wild
		- ★Helps with opportunity assessment and influence teams to care about problems
- Common pitfalls -- what can go wrong with analytics 
	- Metrics not tied to real customer value. [image](https://i.imgur.com/zlYyBBj.png)
	- Too many metrics → Analysis Paralysis
	- Wrong metrics → Misaligned incentives → wrong outcome
	- Wrong metrics → Missed opportunities → suboptimal outcome
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sorNK4Y.png)
- North star metrics: 
	- What is it? → Metric that’s most predictive of company’s long-term success.
	- Key Characteristics: 
		- Captures core value proposition (value moment) delivered to user★Predictive of company success★Simple (your NSM is only as good as your company's ability to internalize and repeat it)What is a North Star Metric?
	- Identifying your product’s Value Moment
		- What’s the primary value moment?

- Value moment: The way products create value for users is different in each industry.
	- | Industry          | Example value moment                |
	  | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
	  | Media             | Played video/media                  |
	  | Finance           | Completed transaction               |
	  | e-commerce        | Item ordered and delivered(ON time) |
	  | SaaS              | Shared file/chat started, etc       |
	  | HR/Payroll        | Running employee payroll            |
	  | Social networking | Start session                       |
	  | Vacation rental   | Booking                             | 
- Identifying your product’s natural usage frequency
	- Natural usage frequency: Match it to your product’s natural usage patterns
		- Daily: social media, gaming
		- Weekly: business software, video on-demand service
		- Monthly: online publication subscription, clothing retailer, banking app
		- Annually: tax software, holiday card app
	- What is my product’s natural usagefrequency?
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/wTwzQ2U.png)
- Metric Types: Options to choose North Star Metric from
	- Metrics should address the full customer lifecycle
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/v6bJGXY.png)
	- Reach:
		- What is it? → Total number of people who have used the product in a recent time period / maximum number of users who could reasonably be activated.
		- Examples:
			- Total registered accounts
			- Paid monthly users (Dropbox)
			- Market share (e.g. % of Fortune 1000 as customers)
	- Activation: 
		- What is it? → Activation is a foundational step that primes a new user to become an active user
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CRhIB13.png)
	- Active Users
		- What is it?→ Counts the number (or %) of users that have taken a key action and received value from your product within a recent time period.
		- Active Users = Value Moment + Natural Usage Frequency
		- Examples: 
			- Monthly active riders (Uber)
			- Daily Active People (Instagram)
			- % of members that watch 15+ minutes per month (Netflix)
	- Engagement: 
		- What is it? It accounts for depth (more intense usage), breadth (more varied features) and frequency (more # of days) of completing key actions.
		- Examples: 
			- Number of videos watched
			- Messages sent
			- Chat sessions with >10 messages
			- Number of orders (Cameo)
			- Number of days active (in previous 7 days)
			- Cart conversion rate
	- Retention
		- What is it? Rate at which users come back to use a product within a certain time period
		- Examples: 
			- Day-7 retention of watching videos
			- 3-month retention rate of meditators
			- Week-4 retention for riders
	- Revenue: 
		- What is it : Amount of money being made by the business
		- Examples: 
			- GMV (marketplace)
			- ARR/MRR (SaaS)
			- Transaction volume ($)
			- Ads revenue
			- Affiliate revenue
			- Net Revenue Retention (Starting revenue + expanded revenue - contracted revenue
			- churned revenue/Starting revenue)
	- Business-Specific
		- What is it? These are the less generalizable metrics that are still very relevant to a particular business
		- Ex
			- Data center burn
			- NPS
			- CSAT survey
			- Referral rate
			- Duolingo Learning Competency (CEFR)
	- Recap - Metric types
		- **Reach** (total user-base that can be engaged)
		- **Activation** (rate at which new users → activated users)
		- **Active Users** (# of users that do value moment at a natural usage frequency)
		- **Engagement** (depth, breadth and frequency of usage - not all users are created equal)
		- **Retention** (rate at which users are still using the product days,weeks later)
		- **Revenue** (total $ made by the business)
		- ** Business-specific**
	- North Star Metrics : *choosing a North Star Metric*
		- Class examples: Mixpanel, Spotify, airbnb, amazon
- Counter-metrics: Aligning metrics to customer value isn’t enough. You still need checks and balances.
	- [Not sure what to place this pic under. See video again. ](https://i.imgur.com/XnuswhH.png)
	- Ask yourself: 
		- If I am fixated on the north star metric only, how can I unintentionally end up hurting the user experience and the business? 
		- What checks do I need to add to avoid such an occurrence?
	- | Metric                | Counter metric             |
	  | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
	  | Subscription purchase | Activation rate, Retention |
	  | Ad revenue            | NPS, Retension             |
	  | Visits                | Conversion rate            |
	  | LTV                   | CAC                        |

## PPT
## Assignment
Over the past 5 weeks we did deep dives into different aspects of your product. This week we will take a huge step - you will start writing your PRD

## 📌 To do

🌈 Start writing your PRD

  

PRD ie. the Product Requirements Document is a document that acts as the main source of truth for your product. It may be known by different names in different organizations - Product Spec, Concept note, PR-FAQ, etc. - but all of these serve the same function.

A good PRD greatly increases the probability of success of your product.

-   It helps in building a shared purpose.
-   It helps in building a common understanding on the problem.
-   It builds a clear view on the solution and ensures and aligns expectations

While the content in PRDs varies across industries, organizations,  and more, most good PRDs have the following building blocks

-   Context / Summary
-   Objective & Success criteria
-   Problem
-   Customers
-   Solutions
-   Assumptions
-   Flowcharts/Diagrams/Mockups
-   Go-to-market plan
-   Distraction
-   Future scope
-   FAQ

Many of these have been covered in previous sessions, and many will be covered in future sessions. We will build on the base PRD you create this week. As and when we finish a session, the relevant section will be added to the PRD. By the end of the program you should have a world-class PRD for your product :)

🌈 We have prepared a template PRD based on what Khilan uses at Razorpay. You can copy it into your workbook and fill it in

# Week 7
## Prereads: 

YAY! 🥳 One step closer to the finish line. It has been such a pleasure hosting you all.

With everyone now having a good understanding of how to write a PRD in the last session, it is now time to focus on the soft skills required for becoming a great Product Manager. Storytelling is a valuable skill. Your product won't be a success if the team and the customer cannot understand what you're building.

## PPT
## Assignment

Over the past 6 weeks we have learned several key skills in product management.This week we will zoom out a bit and map out how we want our career to look like, and how we can acquire the required skills/experience to achieve it. It has 2 sections

## 📌 To do

## Career Canvas

🌈 Fill up your career canvas

  

Since we are all product managers(or aspiring product managers), an interesting approach to career planning is to treat your career like a product. Try to step back and objectively examine your career. Check if it is on track to reach your goals. If not, make the required changes.

The career canvas is a great way to map out your career aspirations. It has the following sections

-   Value statement: What is your personal mission
    
-   Long term goal: Goal with a 5 year timeline
    
-   Mid-term goal: Goal with a 1-3 year timeline
    
    -   Current skills
    -   Required Skills
-   Near-term goal: Goal with a 6-12 months timeline
    
    -   Current skills
    -   Required skills  
          
        ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/12a/de1/a3d/a14.png)

Remember to set SMART goals ⇒ Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and with a Time frame.

## Career Roadmap

🌈 Fill up your career roadmap

  

Once you fill up your career canvas, how you plan to get the skills and experience you need to achieve your goals can then be chalked out as a career roadmap. Map out what you need in order to close the gap between where you are now and where you want to reach. Identify the skills you want to improve, and think about concrete steps you need to take to build those skills.

Mark them against a timeline. Each item should be something you can check off the list.

![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/50f/ba2/854/a15.png)

A sample career roadmap

Keep the roadmap realistic. Try not to crowd it with too many tasks in one quarter. This will help you actually stick to the roadmap. If you miss out on a few tasks, don't get discouraged. Progress is progress, however small it may be :)

🌈 You can find templates for both of these in [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lwWD7Hs=/). Duplicate it, fill it up and paste a link to it in your assignment workbook

## PPT
- Ankur Gattani
	- VP growth and marketing-webengage
- Retension as a foundation of growth: topic
- Back in ‘08
	- Launching a social media startup a day before Convocation from IIM Cal
	- Starting up was still novel
	- UI-UX in MS Powerpoint!
	- ”Use Cases” was an unfamiliar term
	- And then designed an award winning – but still impractical solution to track school kids
	- Moved from Product to CRM Side of things
- As we speak about Retention 
	- Why should you care
	- The Terms 
	- The Data Story
	- Channels
	- Personalization
	- Bringing it together
- 1. An Adjacent Story – Overlaps with Product
	- Retention is about Data Driven Growth – lots of workflows, automations, data models, user insights > Similar Skill Sets
	- As a PM, you can bake growth pieces into the product
	- Oh, and given the market, it’s a great career path in itself
	- Understand Funnels Once, use it everywhere 
	- PLG is a hot term lately! you’ll see how the ‘G’ works
- acquisition without retention = bucket with leaks
- Get Funded, Jump on the Growth Treadmill
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5bsTFUF.png)
- Let’s break the big words down: CAC
	- 1. Customer Acquisition Cost=Money spent in acquiring New Customers
	- 2. Simplistically, the spend on paid marketing efforts / No. of New Customers Acquired
- GMV
	- Gross Merchandize Value = the MRP value of all the products you’ve sold
	- Doesn’t cover discounts etc.
	- In Marketplaces that don’t do buy/sell (hold inventory) this is a metric of scale and can be FAR away from Revenue, which is a % of GMV then.
- CM: Contribution Margin
	- 1. CM 1= Gross Margin =Sale Price – Cost Price
	- 2. CM 2= Sale Price – Cost Price - Cost of Fulfilment 
		- (typically any variable costs associated with fulfilling each order comes here)
- A little math - CLV a.k.a CLTV
	- Customer Lifetime Value =Sumtotal of the Contribution Margin from a single Customer over the period of his lifetime
		- Rs. 1000 - average order value (after discount, not MRP level) 
		- 40% Cost of Product to Seller 
		- 25% Cost of Delivery 
		- 15%Payment Gateway / Referral Margin 
		- 20% Contribution Margin = Rs. 200A little math - CLV a.k.a CLTV
- And a summation: CLV = ΣCM2
	- A consumer places 5 such orders in his lifetime, i.e the CLV = 5 x 200 = Rs. 1000
	- Now, what’s the lifetime?
	- Say, x months or y orders that he’ll place before he churns.
	- Now what’s the churn? Break up!
- Let’s come back to our treadmill
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6p0Kt4p.png)
- Now we don’t want that...So How do you track Churn / Lifetime?
	- Using Cohorts. Cohorts = Groups of people that share a characteristic – often the acquisition time frame.
	- Why Look at Cohorts? --> Watching Cohorts = Measuring outcome of efforts
- Reading Cohorts
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/5FtiiBA.png)
- Other Cohorts that lead to business outcomes: 
	- Is the Average Order Value increasing?
	- Is the Category Penetration increasing?
- Implications on Acquisition
	- Acquisition Channel wise cohorts? Are affiliates giving you poor quality customers who’re not repeating?
	- Is that new campaign on FB giving you super high-quality customers – so you can now setup lookalikes on this cohort?
	- Are you better off promoting Shoes or Shirts in your acquisition campaigns?
- Implications on Product Portfolio
	- Are there ample cross-sell opportunities to expand average order value > Contribution Margin > Lifetime value
- Trust you know about Conversion and Funnels by Now?
	- So what’s the handshake point between Acquisition and Retention?
	- The customer saw your ad, clicked, came to the site – you did a great job converting him, so he placed his first order and you’re celebrating.
	- Err, premature. 
	- 80% of the customers will not repeat EVER
- sc
	- <!--⚠️Imgur upload failed, check dev console-->
	- <!--⚠️Imgur upload failed, check dev console-->
- Post First Date: Will he call?
	- One guy creeps you out, so you block him
	- The other guy charms his way to your attention to deserve the second date
	- As a brand, what’s the obvious thing to do?
	- Gets harder because there are dozens of brands trying their luck and wits!
- Enter Growth Loops – The little things you do.
	- Well thought through message = high on relevance = high on personalization
	- To get there, you need to get your House in Order = Setup your Data Stack
	- User Data = User Profile Info
	- Events Data = User Activities – A page browsed, A product added to cart, a search initiated, an order placed, a banner clicked
	- Event Attribute = the page in question, the product id in question, the query term
	- Capture > Organize > Leverage
- The Data Pieces need to be connected and speak to each other
	- Everyone knows primary key, foreign key?
	- Pure Analytics gives you events, but not connected to users!
	- Unless data is mapped to user, it’s not usable for engagement.
	- Consolidate Data:
		- Before Entry : Ads Clicked, Channel of Acquisition, Device / Operating System...
		- On the Site : Wishlist Additions, Size Checks, Brand Filters, Location Selection...
		- After Order : Calls to Call Center, Open Tickets, Email Opens, Clicks, Push Clicks...
- And it needs to start early in the journey
	- If you don’t put in the right data structure and stack, to re-do this later is a lot more work.
	- There comes the sponsor plug :)
- You’ve got your data stack sorted, now what?
	- When’s the first nudge? 
	- Which Channel would you use?
	- What would you tell them?
- Triggers
	- Trigger = the reason why you’ll communicate
	- User Event TriggersCart / Wishlist / Search Abandon
	- Product Event TriggersBack in Stock, Price Drop, Low Stock
	- Lifecycle Triggers7 days / 30 days / 1x the usual interval etc.
- Channels
	- Email
	- Push Notifications
	- In-App - on Website or within Mobile App
	- Web Push Notifications
	- Whatsapp
	- SMS
	- FB Audience
	- Google Audience
	- IVR – Voice Calls?
- Frequency, Relevance and Spam
	- Low Relevance, High Frequency = SPAM
	- Low Relevance, Low Frequency = You’ll be forgotten
	- High Relevance, High Frequency = Need to find the sweet spot
- Journey
	- Journeys combine different channels and messages together. 
	- A carefully crafted series of messages that also change based on the user’s response and action.
		- Cart abandoned journey can stop if user places the order
		- Can get more aggressive if the user’s opening the mail / visiting the cart but not transacting
	- Combining channels to maximize impact
		- Reachability to Channel
		- Preferred Channel / Affinities / Responsiveness
		- Intensity and Continuity of Messaging
			- Message sent on Push should continue in-app
- The little things: 
	- One Big Impact = Dozens of growth loops, optimized each step of the way.
	- Consolidated Metric : Uplift in the KPI vis-à-vis Control Group. Eg. Cart Recovery.
	- Channel Metrics: Email
		- Audience Size with Permission
		- Reachability ( Engagement History)
		- Open Rates
		- Click-to-Open-Ratio
		- Conversion Rate
	- The point of automated trigger-based journeys is that you’ll be able to keep making small tweaks everyday to perfect each little piece
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZkiGRL2.png)
- What to say? Segmentation & Personalization 🎨
	- Say you’re sitting in a flight ✈ and have an interesting person sitting next to you.
	- Will you say the same thing to both Amitabh Bachchan and Alia Bhatt?
		- OK, maybe ‘I’m a huge fan’. If that’s all you’re going to say.But then it’ll be Coolie & KBC in one case, and Dear Zindagi on the other.Does the same principle apply to your consumers?
- RFM
	- Recency = Time Since Last Purchase (High Score = Bought yesterday)
	- Frequency = No. of Purchases
	- Monetary Value = Average Value of Purchases
	- For a Gaming company, this might look like
		- R = Time since last session
		- F = No. of Sessions
		- M = Average Session Duration
	- Combining these together, you’ll get a few heuristics on Audience Profiles.
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sP5gwRx.png)
- Dynamic micro segments: 
	- People who bought their first pair of shoes yesterday”
	- Audience will keep entering and exiting this segment
	- So if you setup a daily recurring campaign to this audience, it’ll go to a new set of users everyday.Dynamic Micro-Segments
- Personalization easier to handle than Segmentation
	- 100s of segments = 100s of messages and campaigns to manage
	- Personalization allows content to change based on segment
		- If male, visual1, if female visual2
		- If novelty seeker, visual1, else if discount seeker, visual2, else visual3
	- Personalization can also go 1:1 using content from user / event attributes!
- PM
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/EjZ9RQc.png)
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/1CGF9OD.png)
- How the whole thing comes together:
	- Dozens of growth loops with highly personalized messaging which keep the user engaged and converting and deliver the LTV that you’re looking for!
- Ending note: Obviously, there’s more than can be covered in an hour!
	- So I’m currently setting up an entire education and career advancement playbook with hands-on workshops and live case studies.
	- Will launch in the next quarter, so if you want to be in the loop, drop a quick note on Learn@webengage.com
	- And I’m accessible on Linkedin as well!













## Assignment
This week we will dive deeper on how to get customers/users for your product

### 📌 To do

### User Profiles

🌈 Create at least 2 user profiles

  

User profiles (also known as user personas) are a great way to develop empathy towards end users of your product. Considering that one of the main responsibilities of a Product Manager is to act as the voice of the customer, user profiles are a very useful tool to master.

![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/192/9ed/348/a16.png)

The user profile represents a broader customer group which resembles to the most common target audience. It consolidates expansive customer data into a single document that is both easy to refer and easy to understand. Ideally the user persona should be based on real data, which can be obtained from surveys, questionnaires, analytics and interviews. For the sake of this assignment you can use hypothetical data or data from other similar products.

Try to make your user personas as diverse as possible (while still remaining in the target audience of your product). 3-5 user profiles should cover almost all user groups that fall into your target audience.

🌈 You can fill out this user persona template. Feel free to customize it or create your own from scratch.

### Consumer Psychology

<aside>🌈 Incorporate at least one element of user psychology into your product.

</aside>

Users are irrational, they don’t always make the most logical choice. The choices that your users make depend on a variety of internal and external triggers. Understanding consumer behavioral psychology can be an extremely useful tool to drive user actions, form habits and unlock growth opportunities

**Here are some consumer psychology principles that you can apply to drive growth in your product:**

-   **Accomplishment**: Make users feel that they have overcome a challenge or accomplished something. eg: Linkedin profile completion, Duolingo streaks
    
    ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/acf/d0e/670/a17.png)  
    
-   **Ownership**/**Status**: Create status. Give the owner a sense of ownership. eg: Collecting Pokemons, CRED coins, Premium credit cards.
    
    ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/7db/b94/431/a18.png)  
      
    
-   **Scarcity**: People want things that are rare or that will run out soon. eg: Flash sales in ecommerce apps, "only x left" popups, invite only apps.
    
    ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/22f/c3f/8ca/a19.png)  
    
-   **Social influence**: People can be nudged to follow others. eg: Recommendations - people who bought x also bought y and z
    
    ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/906/8e2/b91/a20.png)  
    
-   **Unpredictability**: Give users a sense of anticipation. eg: scratch cards
    
    ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/e93/58e/a94/a21.png)  
    
-   **Loss Aversion**: People hate losing more than they like winning. You can change small things in your product to tap into that. eg: Investing apps saying you are losing x a year vs saying you could be making x a year.
    
    ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/1a6/14d/55f/a22.png)
    
-   **Meaning**: Make the user feel he/she is a part of something big. Make them feel good. eg: contributing knowledge/money, tipping
    
    ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/638884/images/b96/3a7/afb/a23.png)
    

For this assignment, identify psychological principles that you can apply, and specify where/how you will add them to your product.

### Monetization

<aside>🌈 Design a pricing plan for your product

</aside>

You need to start thinking of monetization early in the product's life cycle. Your product needs to generate revenue, otherwise it does not make sense to build it(in most cases). On the other hand, price is one of the most important factors that people have when deciding whether to use your product or not.

This makes monetization and growth go hand in hand. A product offering can grow effectively only when priced right, ie. when a user feels that the value they receive from the product justifies the price.

Here are some pricing models that you can apply to your product:

-   **Subscription**: Consumer pay a periodic payment for continued service. This results in a consistent revenue for the product. eg: SaaS like Adobe products, Netflix, etc.
-   **Dynamic pricing**: Price changes based on the factors like time of the day, demand, supply, weather. This leads to growth by manipulating demand/supply using pricing. eg: Uber, Swiggy
-   **Auctions**/**Bidding:** Customers place their bids, the highest price is accepted. eg: Ebay, Google adwords
-   **Pay as you go:** Pricing changes based on customer's usage. This taps into the customer's willingness to pay proportional to the value they receive. eg: API rate limiting, Cloud storage
-   **Freemium:** Offer a free version of your product with the option to pay for more advanced features. eg: Linkedin, Dropbox

### 📌 To do

Over the past 8 weeks you have been thinking of your product as a whole. This week you will drill it down to an MVP that your team can ship as soon as possible.

### Minimum Viable Product

🌈 Spec out the MVP for your product

  

The main goal of your MVP is to validate the problem, ie. to see if the problem actually exists and if people care enough to find a solution for it. Wasting resources to solve a problem that does not exist is a very common trap. MVPs help reduce this risk. Your MVP should solve the core problem addressed by your product, ie the core value proposition from assignment 3. Once your MVP meets the success criteria you can build out more features.

Iterative product development. Once you know that you are solving a real problem you can add features that improve the product experience

The main goal of your MVP is to **validate your problem statement by spending minimum resources.** This requires you to strike a balance between functionality and resource requirement. Too much functionality and you may end up wasting valuable resources, too little and users may not see the value in your product.

Your MVP spec needs to cover the following

-   What: Briefly explain what the MVP will do
-   Why:
    -   State the problem you are trying to solve
    -   Explain how the MVP will validate the problem
-   Scope: Explain in detail what the functionality of your MVP will be.
    -   In Scope: Define what your product should be able to do
    -   Out of scope: Specify what aspects of your product you will not be building in the MVP.
-   User flows
-   Success metrics: One or more metrics that will determine if your MVP validated your problem statement
-   GTM: Your product's Go-to-market strategy. If you are building a product for an existing business, think of how the business can successfully launch for your MVP while not affecting the core business. If you are building a new product, specify how you will get the word out. If your GTM strategy involves multiple steps, add a timeline.

Feel free to add more details to your MVP spec, the above fields only specify the minimum requirements.
