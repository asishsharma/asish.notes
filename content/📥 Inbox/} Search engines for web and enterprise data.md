## week 1. Intro
AI notes: 
1. **Introduction to Search Engines and Information Retrieval**
    
    - Overview of search engines, their evolution, and terminology (e.g., information retrieval, document retrieval).
    - Importance of information formats: structured (e.g., books) vs. unstructured (e.g., plain text) and multimedia (e.g., images, videos).
    - Examples of search engines: Google, Bing, Baidu, and embedded systems (e.g., Windows 10 search, UST library system).
2. **Types of Search Applications**
    
    - **Web Search**: Searches the internet for publicly accessible content.
    - **Vertical Search**: Domain-specific searches, such as UST course search.
    - **Enterprise Search**: Restricted to internal corporate data, requiring security for different user roles.
    - **Embedded Search**: Device-based search for data like images or emails on smartphones and operating systems.
3. **Advanced Search Features and Structures**
    
    - **Federated Search**: Combines results from multiple sources using a standardized format (e.g., Hong Kong Academic Library Link).
    - **Meta Search**: Aggregates results from various search engines without standardization (e.g., Dogpile.com).
    - Search on various fields, using filters like date ranges, and grouping by type or relevance.
4. **Practical Applications and Techniques**
    
    - **Custom Search**: Delegates searches from a site to a search engine and presents results on the custom page.
    - **File Search in OS**: UNIX/Linux (grep command), Windows (advanced indexing options).
    - **Enterprise/Product Search**: Utilizes structured data collections and applies filters and sorting (e.g., Amazon.com sorting by date, price).

How do Ecommerce engines make money. 
- **Business Models of Search Engines:**
    - Sell software to organizations (e.g., Google Appliance).

- **User Profiles:**
    - Tailor ads based on user preferences.
    - Increase ad effectiveness.
