- CCAR: comprehensive capital assessment and review
- implemented in 2014. Deregulation has happened since,  and banks dont need to spend as much effort on it anymore.
- purpose: forecast a bank's balance sheet and income sheet(in a time window, and bucketed into categories such as loan interest income and owner real extate expenses)
- we do forecasting with the purpose of stress testing, by predicting for 'what if' scenarios provided by the government(Federal reserve) such as different macro economic factors(GDP, CPI, unemployment). will be used by bank to plan/adjust their strategy for loans, etc. 
- eg. expense $=f(x)=\alpha + \beta_1(GDP)+\beta_2(LBR)+\varepsilon_t$ (typically regression or some other predictor for 2 different macroeconomic variables)
- Types of forecasts: Base(economy as expected), adverse(slight risk), severely adverse(high risk). S# -> stressed scenarios.
