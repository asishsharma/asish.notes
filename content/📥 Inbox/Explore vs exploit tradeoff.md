# [[Explore vs exploit tradeoff]]

---
==Should you choose what you know and get something close to what you expect (‘exploit’) or choose something you aren’t sure about and possibly learn more (‘explore’)==?

Examples: 
	favourite restaurant, or the new one?; 
	current job, or hunt around?; 
	normal route home, or try another?

its a ==tradeoff==
