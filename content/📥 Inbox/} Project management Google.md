## Course 2 - [Project Initiation: Starting a Successful Project](https://www.coursera.org/programs/coursera-for-reliance-iicso/learn/project-initiation-google?specialization=google-project-management)

- Key components of project initiation
	- Why initiation
		- lack of preperation during initiation can lead to MAJOR problems later on: budget shortage, scope creep
	- key components
		- goals
			- what youve been asked to do and what youre trying to acheive
			- goals should be clear
			- typically set by senior leaders
		- scope:  
			- process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project
		- deliverables
			- products and services that you will create for your customer,client or project sponsor
			- can be product features, functionality, or even documents, processes, etc. 
			- can be tangible/intangible
		- success criteria
			- standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching the goal
		- stakeholders
			- people who have an interest in & affected by completion and success of a project 
			- need big inputs from them for the first 4 components
		- resources
			- budget, people and materials available for project
	- Project charter: 
		- document containing the key components along with a summary
	- Next step of initiation: review charter
	- case study: managing Supply and demand for projects in resource space. (i.e. managing people, budget, compute, GPU's etc for all ongoing projects)-- how active listening helps in this. 
		- it is VERY VERY important to clearly listen to  stakeholders and get their inputs
	- cost benefit analysis: 
		- adding up the expected value of a project‚Äîthe benefits‚Äîand comparing them to the dollar costs
		- benefits of doing cba: minimize risks, maximize gaing, clear communication, reduces biases, prevents stakeholder corruption**, strong business case for the project so that org pursues only the most profitable/useful projects. 
		- Also consider intangible benefits: customer/employee satisfaction, employee productivity, brand perception. also consider intangible costs(?)
		- guiding questions: 
			-  (see course)
		- ROI thinking: (gains-costs)/costs
-  Goals, scope, success criteria
	- goals and deliverables: 
	- Set SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound
	- case study: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRjuqo2pYjVQlSvS4m7x8Gptfx0XaeAJ-fh3LVzrKek/edit?usp=sharing)
	- [[Objective & Key Results|OKR's]] 
		- combine goal+metric
		- [resource compilation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/supplement/Tt5Xr/creating-okrs-for-your-project):
	- Scope
		- what is it? : the boundaries of the project
			- what will be included, what will be excluded
			- who will be using it, who will it be delivered to
			- how complex
			- timeline, budget, resources
		- additional questions: 
			- where did this project come from 
			- why is it needed
			- what is the project expected to achieve
			- what does the project sponsor have in mind
			- who approves the final results
		- Monitoring & maintaining scope: 
			- scope creep: changes, growth and uncontrolled factors that affect project's scope at any point after the project begins. 
			-  small updates out of scope dont pose much issue, and can be taken up. 
			- Big updates/changes 
			- 2 sources: external, internal 
			- solutions: 
				- make project plans visible
				- get clarity on project requirements 
				- set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement
				- create a plan for dealing with out of scope requests.--change control process
				- **put your agreement and plans in writing**
			- best practices: define requirements, clear project schedule, Out of scope def, 
			- how to determine if a scope change is acceptable and its effect: triple constraint model
				- further reading: [link](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/scope-management/triple-constraint/)
	- Success: setting, maintaining, and 
		- some defs: 
		- launch: delivering the final result of your project to the client or user
		- landing: measuring the success of your project using the success criteria established at the outset of the project
		- determining project success criteria: 
			- measurable parts of goals
			- get clarity from stakeholders
			- customer metrics: adoption, engagement, etc. 
			- product quality metrics: technical issues/defects, % of features delivered
			- opinion piece on stakeholder expectations measurement: [link](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/tZL2CKGDTGmS9gihg9xpFw_6243c50ecb7a476eb772e17540d4f6ef_Same-Project-Different-Perspectives-PMI.pdf?Expires=1692662400&Signature=gTUQfc3o~SNBKHmE5~KES6I1c4UISycsxigX~Bwy9ev~2lQzJXEhX9MWwHrbXF~vptcuBd8vzB1BrdpvWYCZlPokTxD0KhOfqNqlJ2NGTXO8UTp43Y1xHVisixhjEiO5c~TTi4TgpxwaNlBsnRZWVvgG7zMUSd5x9fCpZ6qXuEY_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)
