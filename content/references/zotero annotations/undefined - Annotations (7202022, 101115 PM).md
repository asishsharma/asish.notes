The term p(D | ) in (7) is obtained by a quadratic approximation of J in terms of the weights and then integrating out the weights. We used the Matlab version version ‘trainbr’ for BNN (applied to a multilayer perceptron architecture). This routine is based on the algorithm proposed by Foresee and Hagan (1997).

In the machine learning community, the term generalized regression neural network (or GRNN) is typically used. We will use this latter term. The GRNN model is a nonparametric model where the prediction for a given data point x is given by the average of the target outputs of the training data points in the vicinity of the given point x (Hardle, 1990). The local average is constructed by weighting the points according to their distance from x, using some kernel function. The estimation is just the weighted sum of the observed res”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2F6taFLuiC%2Fitems%2F4U7S7APE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22600%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Ahmed et al., 2010, p. 600</span>)</span>
